# vtube

Browser-based VTuber mocap app using MediaPipe (FaceLandmarker, PoseLandmarker,
HandLandmarker) + react-three-fiber/Three.js. Drives GLB characters prepared by
the AI-CAD project (`G:\My Drive\AI Platforms\AI CAD`) via a `vtubeRig` recipe
embedded in each exported GLB's `userData`.

## CRITICAL: never run npm in this folder

This project lives on Google Drive; `npm install` here corrupts `node_modules`.
Always build through `.\build.ps1` (mirrors to a local build folder, copies
dist back), same as the AI-CAD project.

## Wiki — check before, update after

A knowledge wiki lives at `G:\My Drive\AI Platforms\Wiki` (markdown notes in
`vault/`, cross-linked with `[[note-id]]` syntax, visualized in `index.html`).
It documents *why* things are built the way they are and the bug history behind
current design choices — this file documents *what's true right now*.

**Before** starting any non-trivial task here (bone driving, coordinate
conversion, GLB loading, anything touching `GlbBoneDriver.ts`/`worldFrame.ts`):
check `vault/vtube/` and `vault/shared/` for relevant existing notes first.

**After** resolving a non-trivial bug or architecture decision: add or update a
note in `vault/vtube/`, `vault/shared/`, or `vault/issues/` as appropriate, AND
update the `status`/`updated`/`links` fields in the `wiki-chain` block at the
bottom of this file — that block is what keeps the wiki's chain view current
without anyone needing to remember to run a sync separately. See
[[claude-md-chain-architecture]] for why the block is structured this way.

status: GLB bone-driving pipeline stable — full scene-graph traversal refreshes matrixWorld every frame, fixing prior bone drift. SpringBoneSimulator added for secondary motion. Finger driving now works via inferFingerLmPair() fallback in parseVtubeRig() — Mixamo bone names are pattern-matched to MediaPipe hand landmark pairs when lmPair is absent from the GLB recipe (AI-CAD exports fingers with empty fields). VRM-vs-GLB pipeline question for Project AIBO characters still open.
